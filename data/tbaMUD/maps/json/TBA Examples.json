Rick Husband paid tribute to fallen astronauts from space, just four days before he died.\u0022They made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives and service to the country and for allmankind,\u0022 the Texas native said Jan. 28, on the 17th anniversary of the Challengerexplosion. The 45-year-old former Air Force test pilot was selected as an astronaut in 1994on his fourth try. Space flight was his lifelong passion, along with singing. This was hissecond space flight. Personal data: Married, two children.   William McCool was an experienced Navy pilot with more than 2,800 hours in flight. Buttwo weeks into his first trip into space, the 41-year-old astronaut was bursting withamazement. \u0022There is so much more than what I ever expected,\u0022 McCool told NPR on Jan. 30.\u0022Its beyond imagination, until you actually get up and see it and experience it and feelit.\u0022 The former Navy test pilot grew up in Lubbock, Texas, and became an astronaut in 1996.Personal data: Married, three children.   Michael Anderson accepted the risks of space flight willingly. \u0022I take the risk because Ithink what were doing is really important. If you look at this research flight ... thepotential yield that we have is really tremendous,\u0022 he said. Anderson, 43, was born in NewYork and grew up on military bases. He was flying for the Air Force when NASA chose him in1994 as one of only a handful of black astronauts. He traveled to Russias Mir space stationin 1998. Personal data: Married.   Kalpana Chawla wanted to design aircraft when she emigrated to the United States fromIndia in the 1980s. The space program was the furthest thing from her mind. But \u0022one thingled to another,\u0022 the 41-year-old engineer said, and she was chosen as an astronaut in 1994.Chawla was the first native of India to fly on a space shuttle but the second in space,after Rakesh Sharma, who flew on an Indo-Soviet mission in 1984. This was Chawla\u0027s secondspace flight. Personal data: Married.   David Brown was a Navy novelty: a jet pilot as well as a doctor. He was also probably theonly NASA astronaut to have worked as a circus acrobat. (It was a summer job duringcollege.) He said what he learned about \u0022the teamwork and the safety and the stayingfocused\u0022 carried over to his space job. He joined the Navy after his medical internship, andheld a captain\u0027s rank. NASA chose him as an astronaut in 1996. This was the 46-year-oldVirginia native\u0027s first space flight. Personal data: Single.   Laurel Clark was a diving medical officer aboard submarines and then a flight surgeonbefore she became an astronaut in 1996. This was her first space flight. She had been onboard Columbia to help with more than 80 science experiments. \u0022She was doing something thatshe cared deeply about, that she was very good at,\u0022 said her father, Robert Salton. In fact,he said, \u0022she was pretty good at everything.\u0022 The 41-year-old\u0027s hometown was Racine, Wis.Personal data: Married, one child.
